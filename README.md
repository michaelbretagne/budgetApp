## Budgety

This is a JavaScript app that can track your incomes and expenses. It also calculates the global budget for the month.

This project is a part of  **[The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview)** on **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/)**.

By creating this app along with the instructor I learned a lot of new things in JavaScript like:

- how to organize and structure my code using modules and functions
- how to make JavaScript code interact with webpages: DOM manipulation.
- how to select and change webpage elements, create new elements and handle DOM events.
- how to work with function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures, the bind and apply methods, and more.
